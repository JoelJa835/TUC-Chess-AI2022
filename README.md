# TUC-Chess-AI2022
A project developed for an AI course at Technical University of Crete in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The environment and the graphics were provided and we had to work on the agent itself.  Specifically, the first implementation was the minimax algorithm along with extensions that aim to improve the efficiency of the agent and the second was the Monte Carlo algorithm.Worth noting that the monte carlo algorithm isnt completed yet.
